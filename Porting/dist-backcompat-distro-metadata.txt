# dist-backcompat-distro-metadata.txt

# This file holds configuration data for Porting/dist-backcompat.pl.  Blank or
# all-whitespace lines are ignored.  Lines starting with a '#' are comments
# and are also ignored.

# There should be one entry in this file for each distribution ("distro")
# underneath 'dist/' in the Perl 5 core distribution which has had a separate
# release to CPAN.*

# *In terms of the categorization employed within Porting/dist-backcompat.pl,
# those are distributions which are categorized as 'native', 'generated' or
# 'cpan' and excludes those categorized as 'unreleased'.  As of Jan 10 2022,
# there are 40 released distros and 1 unreleased distro.  Those numbers may of
# course change in the future.

# Each entry consists of a pipe-delimited string of 1 or more columns.
# Column 1: The distribution's name (in "Some-Module" format)
# Column 2: The minimum Perl version required for that distribution, if
# explicitly specified or otherwise determined.  Should be specified in
# "5.mmmppp" format, e.g., 5.008001 for perl-5.8.1.

# Additional columns to be added as needed.
