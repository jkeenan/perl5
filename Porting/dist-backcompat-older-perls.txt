# Porting/dist-backcompat-older-perls.txt

# This file holds configuration data for Porting/dist-backcompat.pl.  Blank or
# all-whitespace lines are ignored.  Lines starting with a '#' are comments
# and are also ignored.

# All remaining lines are labels for older perl executables as built over many
# years by H. Merijn Brand ("Tux") and stored on various iterations of our
# development server known as Dromedary (currently dromedary.p5h.org).  The
# labels are spelled with the convention Tux uses, namely, the string 'perl'
# followed by a 3-part version number for the most recent maintenance or
# production release for a given Perl release cycle.
