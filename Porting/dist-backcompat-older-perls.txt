# Porting/dist-backcompat-older-perls.txt

# This file holds configuration data for Porting/dist-backcompat.pl.  Blank or
# all-whitespace lines are ignored.  Lines starting with a '#' are comments
# and are also ignored.

# All remaining lines are labels for older perl executables as built over many
# years by H. Merijn Brand ("Tux") and stored on various iterations of our
# development server known as Dromedary (currently dromedary.p5h.org).  The
# labels are spelled with the convention Tux uses, namely, the string 'perl'
# followed by the shortest possible way to refer to a Perl release cycle or
# production release.  In the relevant directory on Dromedary, a two-part label such as
# 'perl5.6' is actually a symlink to an executable file for the last
# production release in a given Perl development cycle -- in this case, to
# 'perl5.6.2'.  For the current development cycle, we use a three-part label like
# 'perl5.34.0' to directly indicate an executable file, the reason presumably
# being that there may be further maintenance releases for the current version
# and we create a symlink only to the most recent maintenance release.
